# FreedomBox Foundation design files for ikiwiki

Files for [[ikiwiki|http://ikiwiki.info]] themes and templates.  These were put together for the [[FreedomBox Foundation|http://freedomboxfoundation.org]] website.

##Content

### Templates

Directory containing new templates as well as changes to default ikiwiki template files.  These files are not very useful without the "freedomboxfoundation" theme. Most important are the modifications to page.tmpl

On Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions, copy the files in this directory to /usr/share/ikiwiki/templates/ and run ikiwiki -setup or rebuild your wiki to see the results.

### Theme

Directory containing the "freedomboxfoundation" theme.  These files are not very useful without our modified ikiwiki templates.

freedomboxfoundation/img contains all the images you'll need, plus other images we use for the freedombox and sources such as GIMP .xcf and SVG files
freedomboxfoundation/js contains minified JavaScript, source tarballs, and LibreJS licensing information
freedomboxfoundation/local.css is the modified stylesheet, which is not very useful without page.tmpl
src/ contains source files we don't need to distribute with the theme but are kept for historical purposes, such as old mockups

On Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions, copy the files in this directory to /usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/ and run ikiwiki -setup or rebuild your wiki to see the results.  Then, browse to <yourwikiurl>/ikiwiki.cgi?do=setup and enable the "freedomboxfoundation" theme.

### Test

Directory containing an example that can be used to tweak/configure your own theme without an ikiwiki installation.

style.css is the default ikiwiki stylesheet, you don't want to edit this
local.css is the stylesheet you want to edit
wiki.html is the HTML file you should view in a browser to see the results of your changes
home.html is the HTML file for the design of the foundation homepage, much of this will likely be split out into a separate ikiwiki template (like home.tmpl)

## Installation

The bare minimum is given here. For detailed ikiwiki installation instructions see [[http://ikiwiki.info]].
